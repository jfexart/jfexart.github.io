I'm Jorge, a [Y2K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem) survivor. Here's a little about me:

In 1985, I was born in [Caracas, Venezuela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracas).

In 1988, our family moved to [Maturín, Venezuela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matur%C3%ADn).

In 1991, I took my first steps in computing. My parents enrolled me in an MS-DOS course. It was hard to pay attention, I just wanted to play [OutRun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_Run).

In 1992, I discovered [The Secret of Monkey Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island), thanks to a friend's dad who did have a computer and who had bought the game. That's where my love for [LucarArts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm_Games) began. Their games, especially [The Monkey Island saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Island) saga, [Full Throttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Throttle_(1995_video_game)) and [Grim Fandango](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grim_Fandango), helped me develop my curiosity and problem-solving skills.

In 1993, my parents bought the first home computer with [Win 3.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x) which I shared with my brothers (leading to many discussions). I just wanted to play games and draw in Paint.

In 1994, my dad gave me a Discman and my first CD, which was the soundtrack of the movie [Super Mario Bros (1993)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._(film)). I think this was my first introduction to rock music.

In 1996, my older brother returned home from a trip with two [Nirvana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(band)) albums: [Bleach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_(Nirvana_album)) and [In Utero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Utero). This was my first contact with grunge, a subculture I still a follow.

In 1998, I connected to the internet for the first time after my brothers and I convinced our parents to get a dial-up internet connection plan. The sound of dial-up is something I can never forget

In 2000, my dad offered to buy me a guitar if I stopped skating. He was afraid I would seriously hurt. It was a difficult decision, but I ended up accepting. I remember it was the cheapest guitar in the store.

In 2001, with my brothers, some friends, and I formed Corrosión, a nu metal band. We were on radio, TV and performed live shows, sharing stages with bands like Liqüet and Despuesdevieja (DDV).

In 2004, I used Linux for the first time and also started programming with Java. Both in college. This experience later guided me professionally when I graduated.

In 2005, with members of Corrosión, I formed Alma Mantra, an experimental rock band. We performed live only twice.

In 2007, I got my first job as a programmer at XP Consultores, a company that made websites.

In 2008, I joined the [OpenSolaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSolaris) community, becoming co-leader of the VOSUG (Venezuela OpenSolaris User Group).

In 2009, with my younger brother, some friends, and I created Pragmatic, a technology services company.

In 2014, I did some important things that are somehow related to each other: I married Daniela, we moved to [Montevideo, Uruguay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montevideo) and I started a new job at [Pyxis](https://pyxis.tech/).

In 2015, I attended a [Pearl Jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Jam) show for the first and only time (for now) in [La Plata, Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Plata). It was very exciting for me to see my favorite band live.

In 2016, I co-founded [Guayoyo](https://guayoyo.io), a cybersecurity boutique firm. This same year, Daniela and I decided to adopt Tito, my first dog.

In 2023, we moved to [Ciudad de la Costa, Uruguay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciudad_de_la_Costa).
